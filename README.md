The project is divided into three question sets: Easy, Moderate, and Advanced. Each set contains SQL queries aimed at extracting specific insights from the dataset.

Here's a breakdown of what each question set accomplishes:

### Easy Question Set:
1. Identifies the senior-most employee based on job title.
2. Lists countries with the most invoices.
3. Finds the top 3 values of total invoices.
4. Determines the city with the highest sum of invoice totals, potentially for organizing a promotional event.
5. Identifies the best customer based on total spending.

### Moderate Question Set:
1. Retrieves the email, first name, last name, and genre of all rock music listeners, ordered alphabetically by email.
2. Lists the top 10 rock bands along with the total track count.
3. Returns track names and their durations longer than the average song length, ordered by length.

### Advanced Question Set:
1. Calculates the amount spent by each customer on the artist who has earned the most. It returns customer names, artist names, and total spent amounts.
2. Determines the most popular music genre for each country based on the highest number of purchases.
3. Finds the customer who has spent the most on music for each country, considering cases where multiple customers share the top spending amount.

This project demonstrates various SQL techniques for data analysis, including aggregation, joins, subqueries, and window functions. It focuses on extracting meaningful insights from the dataset, such as identifying top performers, popular genres, and high-spending customers, which could be valuable for business decision-making in the music industry.
